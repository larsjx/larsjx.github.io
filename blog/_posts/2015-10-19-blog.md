#####**Overview**

This week we learned about another programming construct called classes so let's briefly cover what they are and what you can do with them.

At the most basic level, when creating a class in Ruby we are defining a new type of object, and once we have that class object defined, we can instantiate and interact with multiple examples of it (called instances).

We'll put this into practice by creating a new class of fish called Trout. Once we have created the Trout class we can go on to create more than one individual Trout and give each instance of Trout it's own characteristics and properties.

#####**Attributes**

These attributes of an individual Trout might include its specific subspecies (Brook, Brown, Cutthroat, Rainbow), its location in the river, its age in years, and its length in inches. These are also called instance variables because they can be applied differently to each instance, or to each individual fish in our class.

So now that we've created a new Trout class and given it some attributes that can be assigned to different fish, how can we get it to actually do something other than simply store that information? We'll give it some behaviors.

#####**Behaviors**

Continuing with our example, let's have the Trout class do 4 things. (1) For starters, we need to be able to create new Trout, and (2) we want them to move around in the river. (3) We also want them to get larger over time, and (4) we want to report on the status of any individual fish.

All 4 of these behaviors can be added with instance methods that enable us to interact with any of our instance variables. Specifically, these methods allow us to query and report on a attribute's value, change it, or even delete it. Let's create our basic Trout class now and explore this a little further.

#####**Trout class**

The Ruby code here does 4 different things inside the new class Trout. (1) First, in lines 4-12, we enable the creation of individual fish with their own attributes. We assign fish type and location randomly while accepting years and inches from the requesting instance. (2) Second, the method on lines 14-16 allows our fish to swim up and down the river. (3) Third, the method on lines 18-21 increases the age of each fish. (4) And finally on lines 23-25, we report the current location, age and length of any fish.

#####**Let's do this**

Of course in order to test these new behaviors we need to create a couple of Trout instances so that's what we do in lines 29 and 33. As you can see from the output, Fish 1 turns out to be a Brook Trout that begins life downstream, and Fish 2 is a Brown Trout that starts out upstream. Next in lines 30-31 and 34-35, we assign their age and lengths.

The very last thing we do is call our behaviors in lines 37 to 45. We run a report for each fish, then we age each fish and let them swim up and down the river before running one more report.

As you can see from the second report on each fish, after 1 year our Brown Trout and Brook Trout have switched locations and the Brown Trout has gained 6 inches, while the Brook Trout has only gained 2. I know this isn't a very accurate simulation, but hopefully it gives you a better idea of when and how we can use Ruby classes, instance variables, and instance methods to describe and interact with programming objects.
