#####**Overview**

This week we'll be looking at accessing information from Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects. Both are great tools for creating and managing collections of related information, and both are relatively easy to use. So how do they compare?

According to <a href = "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Hash.html">ruby-doc.org</a>, "... a Hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type." For additional description and a good example of a Ruby hash, see my previous blog post <a href = "006-100515-blog.html">Arrays and Hashes</a>.

Likewise, <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects">MDN</a> tells us that "a JavaScript object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. Also noteworthy, a property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method."

In addition to their similar definitions, the syntax used for creating them is nearly identical:

#####**Creating a new Ruby hash**
{% highlight ruby %}
modern_art = { dorazio: "Logos et Carres",
gorchov: "Comet",
mondrian: "Broadway Boogie Woogie"
pollock: "One: Number 31",
twombly: "Untitled (1970)",
}
{% endhighlight %}

#####**Creating a new JavaScript object**
{% highlight ruby %}
var modernArt = { dorazio: "Logos et Carres",
gorchov: "Comet",
mondrian: "Broadway Boogie Woogie"
pollock: "One: Number 31",
twombly: "Untitled (1970)",
};
{% endhighlight %}

#####**Hash keys and property names**

Both Ruby hash keys and JavaScript property names must be unique so they have that in common. However, JavaScript object properties are really "just ordinary variables, except for their attachment to objects" (MDN).

In contrast, Ruby hash keys can be almost anything including; symbols, strings, numbers, arrays, and even other hashes.

#####**Values**

Interestingly, Ruby hash and JavaScript object property values can also be almost anything. In fact, a JS property value can be another object, or as stated above, it can even be a function.

#####**Accessing information**

There are some basic differences in how we access the information stored in key/value and property/value pairs.

In Ruby, it's really easy easy to access hash values if you know the key, or vice versa if you know the value. For example:
{% highlight ruby %}
hash[key]  => returns value

hash.key(value)  => returns key
{% endhighlight %}

JavaScript also makes it easy to access property values using one of two different formats. These formats are called dot notation and bracket notation. They look like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
object.name  => returns value

object["name"] => returns value
{% endhighlight %}

Most style guides encourage using dot notation whenever possible because it's more concise and easier to read.

However, there are some neat things that you can only do with bracket notation. For example, you can access property names that have spaces in them and you can also dynamically generate property names like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
object["key two"]  => returns value of property "key two"

object["key" + 3] => returns value of property "key3"
{% endhighlight %}

#####**Conclusion**

I've only scratched the surface of Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects, but I hope I have piqued your interest to learn more. For additional info and further examples be sure to check out the official documentation at <a href = "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Hash.html">ruby-docs</a> and <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects">MDN</a>.</div>
