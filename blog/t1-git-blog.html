      Using version control is a way of developing something iteratively and working with a safety net that allows the maker to back up in their creative process. Even better, social version control allows two or more people to particpate on the same project without inadvertantly stepping on each other's work. There are many different software products and services available to facilitate version control and all of them provide the ability to undo changes by going back and forth over time. Of course, they also do much more than that.

      Anyone who has used a word processor to develop a large document can appreciate the value of version control. For example, by creating and saving multiple files (lifestory001, lifestory002 and so on) we're giving ourselves a basic safety net. We can always back up to a previous version. But what if you haven't saved in a while and you don't need to back up quite that far? Fortunately, we can also "undo" or step through changes that we have made since the last time we saved our file. These are both rudimentary forms of version control.

      Now imagine that you are working with other people on the same document. You could have everyone provide their input separately and then merge those files together, but you might prefer to enable something called "Track Changes" instead. As you may know, this document collaboration feature uses color and text to indicate (a) where changes have been made, (b) who made those changes, (c) when they were made, and optionally (d) why they were made. By using "Track Changes", everyone can read multiple versions of each other's input and view each other's comments to create the very best possible product.

      Modern Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that combine the benefits of saving multiple changes, managing undos, and tracking/consolidating changes from different team members â€“ on steroids. While desktop software often provides some of these features for individual files, VCS will do the same thing and more across multiple files, directories and subdirectories.
