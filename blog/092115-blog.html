        <div class="std"><span>Overview</span></div>
        <div class="std">This week we have been focused on learning HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) which is the simple language used to give web pages their content. It's called a markup language because we put markup (tags) around the different types of content we're delivering in a web page.</div>
        <div class="std">This markup provides structure and information to web browsers <em>about</em> the content on your screen, so your browser knows to render this as a headline, that as a paragraph, this as the main section, and so forth.</div>
        <div class="std">We spent a good part of this week creating very simple documents that were properly organized and clearly marked up. However, while it may have been proper (and it was fun to learn), pure HTML can also be boring to look at and interact with as a user. For this reason, early web developers learned how to get creative with their HTML. They took advantage of inline styling techniques to give their pages visual variety and individual style. But HTML alone can only take things so far.</div>
        <div class="std"><span>And that's where CSS (Cascsding Style Sheets) comes in...</span> CSS is a sister language to HTML that we'll be learning about next week so we can start giving our basic HTML documents some pizzaz. We'll be using CSS to provide a layout and visual structure to our web pages, and learning how to apply different backgrounds, fonts, borders, colors, and much more to any element within them. In fact, if you had a chance to see this week's website, you'll understand why I can't wait to get started with CSS!</div>
