## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that elements can interact with each other and/or overlap when you do not want them to and that simply understanding The Box Model and the definitions of Margin, Border and Padding on their own are not enough to prevent this. It's also very important to understand how elements will relate to each other, themselves and the browser window while it's being resized.


## What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned to leverage float, and relative values (vw, em and percentages) whenever possible versus any kind of specific positioning with pixels. I also realized that the next time I attempt to do this, I would definitely like to try starting with a working grid, multiple size background images, and multiple @media queries for more refined placement and alignment at different resolutions. Right now, I'm able to position and move elements around on a static page (or for different resolutions with some experimentation), but I am looking forward to getting to a point where I will just know what to do by looking at the CSS and visualizing the outcome.


## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

It was easiest to implement my headline and the large feature box with variable length body text.

It was most difficult to arrange the navigation elements so they flow properly around the text box whenever the screen is resized. This was also the case with my large photo background. While my pages are now working fairly well at different computer resolutions, their presentation is less ideal (although it does work) on mobile devices.


## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

In this challenge, I learned to place and format different elements using various combinations of float, display, border, margin and padding. I attempted to keep everything fluid to accommodate different resolutions and device sizes, but found that to be quite difficult without a grid system and more than one @media query.
