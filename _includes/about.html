                    <p class="text-muted">After graduating from the University of Minnesota, I began my career as a salesperson for an enterprise messaging startup called St. Paul Software. As the top sales person, I helped create a reseller network before I was recruited to Chicago where I helped launch, sell and deliver a number of IBM's Internet services.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">At IBM, my primary roles were in complex solution design and delivery, technical sales management, and project management.

                    <p class="text-muted">My interests range quite a bit from science and technology to hiking, skiing, fly-fishing and music. I am currently participating in a 19 week immersive training program called <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-ruby-javascript/daily-life/">Dev Bootcamp</a>, in which Iâ€™m learning as much as I possibly can about programming in that short period of time.</p>
