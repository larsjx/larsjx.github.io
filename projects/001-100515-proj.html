        <div class="xlg">Week 4 bonus challenge</div>
        <div class="lg">October 5, 2015 -- Make a homework cheater</div>
        <div class="std"><span>Automatic essay writer</span></div>
        <div class="std">This week's bonus challenge was to make a homework cheater - a short program in Ruby that compiles three different essays on demand. The catch is that our automatic essay writer must do this by:</div>
        <div class="std list">
        <ul>
          <li>Selecting story elements from different variables holding; titles, dates, people's names, and essay content</li>
          <li>Inserting specific phrases such as "(person) was an important person" and "I want to learn more about (topic)"</li>
          <li>Inserting proper pronouns wherever possible (she/he/his/hers)</li>
          <li>Using the person's last name once they have been introduced</li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="std"><span>Requirements were a bit vague</span></div>
        <div class="std">Not unlike a real job, this week's bonus assignment left room for a few assumptions. Since we spent the week learning about arrays and hashes I decided to throw almost everything into a few arrays (title, date, person, and content).</div>
        <div class="std">I also decided to ask the user to choose 1 of 3 stories. Other options would have been (a) to compile all 3 stories in sequence, (b) compile 1 of 3 stories at random, or (c) compile all 3 stories at random.</div>
        <div class="std">Next, I decided to write about 1 woman and 2 men so I could have the program choose pronouns based on who the essay was about. Our instructions hinted that we may 'want to try creating an object' for this, but I felt for the first run, I would use a simple IF statement.</div>
        <div class="std">Most importantly, I decided that all 3 essays would be about wizards.</div>
        <div class="std"><span>Code breakdown</span></div>
        <div class="std">1. I started things off by assigning story elements to my 4 arrays:</div>
        <img src="../imgs/breen-arrays.png" alt="define 4 arrays">
        <div class="std">2. Next I define a method called "essay writer" that accepts 4 arguments and starts off with a simple IF/ELSE statement to determine the pronouns for our story based on the character's name:</div>
        <img src="../imgs/breen-pronouns.png" alt="select pronouns">
        <div class="std">3. The following <span>puts</span> statement is where all of the action happens. It creates the first sentence of our essay by starting off with the person's name (variable), adding a few words, converting and inseerting the date as a string, then adding a period. The next two sentences combine our pronouns (variables), with a few more words. After that, we put the story's title in quotes and list the person's last name (stripped variable) before adding the content of our essay and concluding with a statement that our character's 'contribution is important.'</div>
        <img src="../imgs/breen-puts.png" alt="puts statement">
        <div class="std">4. Our last bit of code is actually where things start off when this is run. It asks the user to select 1 of 3 stories and only allows input between 1 and 3. After that it simply calls and passes 4 arguments (user-selected: title, person, date and content) into the method 'essay_writer'.</div>
        <img src="../imgs/breen-method-call.png" alt="story selector and method call">
        <div class="std"><span>Did I mention there are wizards?</span></div>
        <div class="std">Yep. When you run this code you can select and see 1 of 3 stories about different wizards. Here's what it looks like in action:</div>
        <img src="../imgs/breen-story1.png" alt="user selects 1 for the first story of Breen">
        <img src="../imgs/breen-story2.png" alt="user selects 2 for the second story of Breen">
        <img src="../imgs/breen-story3.png" alt="user selects 3 for the third story of Breen">
        <div class="std"><span>What did I learn?</span></div>
        <div class="std">I'm sure the author of this challenge intended for us to build something with more complex logic than what I came up with, but I still had fun working on this exercise. If I ever revise this, my plan is to make the logic more sophisticated. For example, I would definitely like to eliminate ALL names and pronouns from my content array and include each one logically vs. having some that are still predetermined.</div>
